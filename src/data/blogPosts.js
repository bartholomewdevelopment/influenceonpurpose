      Do you have a high turnover rate?

      Ah, the Great Resignation. We’ve read the headlines screaming all year about the masses of employees turning in their notice (or just disappearing) in search of greener pastures or to escape poor working conditions.

      The costs of turnover are high: recruiting, screening, training, etc. And the longer an employee has been with you, the higher the costs of replacing that knowledge and experience. One of the questions we’re asked as coaches is how to help employers reduce their turnover.

      But before you can jump in and start talking about reducing turnover, you first have to figure out what kind of turnover you have.

      ### Involuntary Turnover

      There are different types of turnover: the first is involuntary turnover. This is where the employer terminated the employment for a variety of reasons: restructuring of the company, bad fit, poor performance, etc. Usually, when turnover is considered a problem, this isn’t the type of turnover we’re talking about.

      ### Voluntary Turnover

      Voluntary turnover is what happens when an employee chooses to leave, and this is what leaders are usually looking to avoid. But even with voluntary turnover, there are different reasons people choose to leave.

      #### Functional Turnover

      The first reason is something that is out of the employer’s power to influence. Perhaps the person is relocating for family reasons, for medical care or to be closer to an aging relative, or because of a spouse or partner’s career opportunity in another place. It can even be that this position just isn’t a good fit for that person. No one is at fault here, it just happens. Cover your bases by conducting a thorough exit interview, then offer any practical assistance you can with their transition and wish them well in their future endeavors.

      The next type of turnover is what we like to call Flow-through Turnover. This is when an employee just outgrows the position they were hired for, which is the case with many entry-level jobs. These types of low-skilled, low-wage jobs are a necessary part of the economy and an individual’s personal career growth. They help people gain experience, develop skills, and pay for schooling or training. Then, when the time is right for them, they can move on to something better, thanks to this initial employment that benefited the company and the individual. This can cover internal promotions and transfers, or the college kid working for minimum wage while they earn their degree.

      Unlike other types of turnover, Flow-through Turnover can be a result of good leadership and an indicator of a healthy culture. It’s a sign that people are being given the opportunity to grow and develop, rather than being held back to fit the needs of the employer. It’s a sign of a regenerative culture, where growth not only occurs but is encouraged and systems are set up to foster that growth, in the people and the culture. And, unlike some types of turnover, it’s not a sign of a dying culture or poor leadership, it's nobody's fault, and it’s nothing that needs fixing. It’s just the nature of some types of employment. Again, treat them well and wish them luck.

      #### Dysfunctional Turnover

      Now we get to the third type of voluntary turnover: Dysfunctional Turnover. This is when good employees and high performers choose to leave their job because of a problem, not as a natural step in their career path. The key here is that they are leaving somewhere, not just going somewhere. This is a sign of an unhealthy work culture; too much of this turnover and it’s the sign of a dying culture. This is the cost of poor leadership.

      At a workshop with a small business, we asked the employees why they left their previous employment. Nearly all of the answers fit into the “unhealthy culture” category: poor work environment, poor treatment, they felt no one listened to them or cared about them. Ironically, no one once mentioned poor pay or benefits. The same was true when we asked what they liked about their current work. Answers included: feeling heard, feeling like the owners cared about them, liking the work environment. Again, no mention of pay.

      That isn’t to say pay and benefits aren’t important, because they are, but people don’t leave a place that pays market rates if there isn’t something else going on. This is the sign of a degenerative culture, a business that is built on mining its employees and stakeholders, rather than building them up to create a self-sustaining, self-healing culture.

      Find out what is driving your involuntary turnover. More often than not, you will find the driver is poor leadership, which leads to an unhealthy or dying culture. This can even happen within a company, when employees are transferring away from a certain section or team at higher rates than other sections. It is poor leadership that is creating a degenerative culture, which in turn drives away the very people needed to make the business successful.

      And the sad part is, most people don’t set out to be poor leaders. Usually, it’s someone trying their best but with no idea of what they are doing wrong or how to fix it if they do know. They are stressed, perhaps moving from crisis to crisis, unprepared or underprepared to help build the kind of team and culture they would really like to lead, or to be the leaders they really want to be. Are you investing in developing your leaders? Are you intentionally creating a culture where people feel heard and valued? Where they feel they are a contributing, vital member of a team, whatever role they fill?

      Because when it comes to curing Dysfunctional Turnover, the best remedy isn’t more money or a better benefits package. It’s good leadership. Good leadership is good business.

      <p>Many years ago, I was watching a presentation given by a mentor of mine. He was explaining the crucial role of values, vision, and mission as a foundation for the strategic planning process. On a flip chart, he drew a diagram of a triangle with three levels. In this way he explained how values provide a structural foundation, vision is built on values, and mission was a strategic expression of the vision.</p>

      <p>As I watched the presentation from the back of the room, I got a different picture. I saw organizations as growing, living things. Values bring life into the organization, vision brings unity and direction, mission is the work of meeting the needs of the stakeholders. I drew a rough picture in my notes that looked something like this:</p>

      <img src="${originalTreeMissionVisionValues}" alt="Rough sketch of a tree" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">

      <p>If you use your imagination, you may be able to see I was picturing a tree.</p>

      <h3>The Roots: Values</h3>
      <p>The roots represent values. These provide the anchor for the organization. They are non-negotiable. They not only provide the foundation for your business, they shape how you live your life. I came to define values as: principle centered ideas by which you measure the worth of actions interactions and outcomes.</p>

      <h3>The Trunk: Vision</h3>
      <p>The trunk of the tree represents vision. As you look to the future, how will the organization be described? This is the challenge to become. The company’s vision is that compelling picture that makes the work worthwhile. As the leader expresses the vision, associates can see and determine for themselves if this is a work they want to be engaged in. The definition of vision is: the desired reality to come.</p>

      <h3>The Branches: Mission</h3>
      <p>The mission is a clear statement of what is required for all stakeholders if you are to accomplish the vision. A mission should take into consideration, customers, employees, owners/investors, business partners and or vendors, and the community. A mission that only recognizes one stakeholder group will not be sustainable. The mission is defined as: the shared purpose that serves all stakeholders. A well-defined mission provides the transition from aspirational to strategic.</p>

      <p>Over the years, the model expanded to show the strategic process more clearly. From the main branches of the tree, secondary and tertiary branches continue. The secondary branches represent the plans created to serve the needs of the stakeholders they extend from. Likewise, the tertiary branches represent the practices developed to execute those plans.</p>

      <p>Unlike the values represented by the roots, plans and practices are very negotiable. Where the roots become permanent and provide consistent nourishment over time, the branches can and should be pruned regularly.</p>

      <p>The significance of this model goes beyond typical strategic planning. Fully understood, the model provides a way to plan and grow the culture you need to accomplish your mission.</p>

      <p>One day I was explaining the model to a client. I told him he could think of the culture of his company similar to the use of the word in the terms horticulture or agriculture. Leaders can cultivate and nurture a culture perfectly designed to get the results they need to accomplish their goals and sustain their success. He suggested the term “busni-culture.” I’m not sure if the term will catch on, I knew he got the picture.</p>

      <p>When I knew I wanted the tree to be a logo for my business, I found a clip art version that served the purpose of showing all of the components of the model:</p>

      <img src="${originalTreeSteps}" alt="Clip art tree showing roots, trunk, and branches" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">

      <p>Over time, I came to understand the model gives a good description of an organization’s unique culture. Leaders feel empowered knowing culture is definable and is something they can influence. However, there was something in the early years I hadn’t gotten a handle on.</p>

      <h3>The Soil: Principles</h3>
      <p>As I have worked with a variety of organizations and individuals, I’ve come to notice they have both unique differences and common traits. The tree in the model effectively represents the organization. However, just as a tree has to be rooted in rich soil to receive the nourishment it needs to grow, each organization needs values that draw from sound principles to gain and sustain vitality.</p>

      <p>Many years ago, in a meeting with a CEO, our conversation included a discussion about core values. I explained there is a difference between values and principles. Values are unique to the individual or organization as described above. Principles exist outside of the individual or organization. The ability to sustain success as an organization is largely determined by how well their values are rooted in sound principle.</p>

      <p>This CEO stopped and pondered. He said, “I’ll have to think about that.” He, like many others, thought of values and principles as meaning essentially the same thing.</p>

      <p>It’s easy to see values as the absolute foundation when you don’t see beyond the boundaries of your own organization. Principle is defined as “A fundamental truth or proposition that serves as a foundation for a system of beliefs or behavior or for a chain of reasoning.” Oxford Dictionary.</p>

      <p>It’s important to understand the difference between values and principles. Our values, in and of themselves, can be constructive, neutral or destructive. For example: the value of honesty based in pride can take you no further than your own reality. Honesty motivated by humility can lead you to the truth. Honesty motivated by arrogance or selfishness (pride) can be destructive.</p>

      <p>Honesty is the value; pride and humility are character traits; individual reality is the counterfeit; truth is the principle. In other words, in order for the value of honesty to prove a sustainable source of nourishment to your organization, it must be rooted in the principle of truth. You will not get to the truth if your pride will not allow you to see beyond your own perspective (reality).</p>

      <h3>Four Universal Principles</h3>
      <p>There are four principles identified as common to any organization or individual regardless of age, race, gender, region or country. The above example points out truth as one of those principles. The other three are work, agency, and love. Though they may be expressed very differently, these four principles are present in and important to any successful organization around the world. To the degree they can be identified and nourished, any culture can be strengthened.</p>

      <h4>Truth: The Courage and Humility to Go Beyond Realities</h4>
      <p>Truth: the courage and humility to go beyond individual and group realities. The feedback you receive from others consists of the perceptions of people who interact with you. To those who express these perceptions, they are realities. Understanding this helps us to be aware of how important these perceptions are to those who shared them. This is a good start.</p>

      <p>The statement “perceptions are realities” is often made in order to state that a situation is unchangeable or that a circumstance is insurmountable. Certainly, perceptions lead to realities, however, there is more to the story. Though perceptions are realities, realities are not necessarily true. Truth is found only after having the humility and the courage to challenge realities. This distinction illustrates that pride leads to self-limiting realities and humility and courage can lead to truth.</p>

      <h4>Work: Applying Focused, Sustained Effort</h4>
      <p>The principle of work comes from a concept sometimes known as “the law of the harvest.” A basic example of this principle is understanding what is required for production of fruit. If you want to have an apple, an apple seed must be planted. The soil will need to have sufficient nutrients. The seed and growing plant will require watering and tending to. As the tree grows, it will need to be nurtured and cared for. As the tree matures it will yield the fruit it is designed to produce. The principle of work is more than just having or doing a job, it is fundamental to any worthwhile accomplishment.</p>

      <p>Work is described as “The magic by which dreams become reality.” Gordon B. Hinckley.</p>

      <p>To quote J. Richard Clarke, “We work to earn a living, that is true, but as we toil, let us also remember that we are building a life. Our work determines what that life will be.”</p>

      <p>Neil A. Maxwell said, “... work is always a spiritual necessity even if, for some, work is not an economic necessity.”</p>

      <p>As I have worked throughout my life to provide for myself and my family, I can look back not only on what has been accomplished but how it has contributed to who I am. This then is my advice: work not only for what you would accomplish but for who you would become</p>

      <h4>Agency: Understanding Choice and Consequences</h4>
      <p>Agency is the ability and privilege to choose and act for ourselves.</p>

      <p>As leaders it is important not only to take ownership of our own choices and their consequences, we need to respect that each of our stakeholders (employees, customers, etc.) choose each day to be engaged with us or not. Acknowledging agency helps leaders work to influence others and avoid the trap of trying to control.</p>

      <p>In business as in life, alignment with a specific course and engagement in the work of that cause are a choice we make. Choice precedes and largely determines both direction and destination. When you choose a path, you choose the place it leads to.</p>

      <h4>Love: The Power and Importance of Relationships</h4>
      <p>The last of the four principles is probably the most powerful, the most unifying and the largest determiner of not only achieving but of defining success. This four-letter word is more likely to cause hard-nosed business leaders to squirm with discomfort than any other.</p>

      <p>I find it makes it easier to discuss and to understand when we talk about the common expressions of love in the business environment. Words like civility, respect, forgiveness and sacrifice are easier to identify in our organizations. It’s also easier to see their impact on creating a vital culture and therefore ultimate success.</p>

      <p>I have noticed for many years and taught my clients: disrespect will always cost you money. Though this is a hard-hitting fact, the cost in dollars in only a small part of the cost when disrespect is expressed or felt. It is important to understand financial loss as a lagging indicator of disrespect realized downstream in the value chain. The earlier signs will be loss of alignment and engagement in the form of demoralization or resentment. When people feel disrespected, the driving agenda in their mind is to get back their dignity.</p>

      <h3>Bringing It All Together</h3>
      <p>Overall, the organizational model of the tree represents the ability to cultivate life and vitality in your organization.</p>

      <p>Over time this model served to help leaders develop a vision for their organizations and act on the culture they needed to succeed. The more I did this work, the more I felt the model needed to be an expression of life and vitality. I also came to understand the importance of the soil and not just a tree suspended in air.</p>

      <p>Look back at the triangle model of values, vision and mission. The hard lines of the structure make it look self-contained with no need for, or acknowledgement of, outside forces. Look now at the model of the tree. The model reaches down for strength and security, it reaches up for growth and expression. Reaching down it finds strength and stability in sound principles. Reaching out it experiences growth and bears fruit in serving stakeholders.</p>

      <p>Fortunately, I have a daughter who is a wonderful artist. I called her and described this model and how I use it to help leaders build the organizational culture they need. I asked her if she could paint me a logo. In addition to the tree itself, I asked her to show the soil as a rich and necessary part of the picture. Below is the painting she created. I couldn’t be more pleased. It shows the health and vitality of the tree in all of its parts. It also shows the richness of the soil.</p>

      <img src="${treeImage}" alt="Painting of a tree with rich soil" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">

      <p>With the help of clients, mentors, advisors, my daughter’s artistic vision, and a very talented friend who helped me see my business from a marketing perspective, that early sketch has become a powerful model for organizational culture.</p>

    excerpt: "A deep dive into embracing vulnerability as a strength.",

    image: weakness, // Placeholder
    content: `
      As I work with leadership coaching clients, one of the early steps in the process is evaluating the current effect of their influence on their stakeholders. One powerful way of doing this is through 360 surveys or collecting feedback from those who are impacted by the leader. While debriefing the survey report with the client, I’ve noticed an unintended problem caused by our current “gentle” language.

      In our professional language, there has been a focus on eliminating the word “weakness” as we evaluate performance. We use words like “development opportunity” instead to avoid hurting someone’s feelings or causing defensiveness. Certainly, it is wise to be respectful of others. There is nothing amiss with showing respect and avoiding creating defensiveness. Respect contributes to strong working relationships. Additionally, people can’t address opportunities for improvement when they become blinded because of defensiveness.

      Though the purpose is good, the strategy is seriously flawed. When we simply replace words that create sensitivity, the very emotions we are trying to avoid are simply transferred to the new word. In effect this will damage our credibility. If you want to destroy the meaning of the words “development opportunity,” use them every time you want to talk about someone’s weaknesses. The outcome of that practice is very predictable. My advice is to call a strength a strength and a weakness a weakness.

      The preliminary problem with this practice comes by failing to focus on the most powerful opportunities you have to improve as a leader. In other words, your most important development opportunities are usually realized by building on your strengths. If all you do is focus on your weaknesses, the best you’ll ever be is average. There is no shortage of evidence indicating the importance of building on strengths. It’s always a shame to see people deny themselves impactful personal growth because they don’t have a constructive way to deal with weaknesses and fail to build on their strengths.

      In pointing out the importance of building on strengths, I’m not saying anything new. The point I am making is to not focus exclusively on strengths and ignore weaknesses. Weaknesses should be recognized and addressed effectively. After acknowledging you have weaknesses, it is useful to identify what type of weakness it is and what effect it has on your outcomes.

      For the purpose of improving leadership influence, I have identified four types of weaknesses:

      The first type I mention is a weakness that has no effect on your desired outcomes. An example (in my case), is my complete lack of competence as a neurosurgeon. Under no circumstance should I ever operate on someone’s brain. I’m okay with that. Brain surgery has nothing to do with the essential functions of any of my roles in life.

      Though the example above is extreme, it illustrates the point. You may have many weaknesses that have no effect on the expectations your stakeholders have of you or your personal goals. When you become aware of a weakness, evaluate the effect this has on your desired outcomes. You may find this weakness is not worth your attention.

      The next type of weakness is as much the organization’s opportunity as the individual’s. It requires understanding your strengths and weaknesses as well as the strengths and weaknesses of those around you. Simply put, you’re just not good at everything. You may be strong in operations and rely on others to make the sale… or visa-versa.

      Awareness of this weakness may identify opportunities for collaboration. Awareness of your strengths and weaknesses as well as your colleagues' can help you see how you can use complementary strengths to accomplish shared goals. This is the essence of team work.

      The third type of weakness is directly related to your ability to do what is expected of you. These are weaknesses in the classic sense which affect current performance or keep you from progressing as you would like. This type of weakness can be addressed by receiving training to overcome a gap in skill or coaching to develop more effective influence strategies. Unfortunately, this is the area we most often address with euphemisms such as “it’s not a weakness, it’s a development opportunity.” This can cause a lack of urgency in making needed improvements. When this becomes a pattern, you will have a culture of failure rather than a culture of accountability.

      The fourth type may not be seen as frequently but it is critical to address. These are the weaknesses we call fatal flaws or derailers. They are caused by behaviors that affect people’s ability to trust you. These include perceptions of honesty, capability or reliability. This happens when people feel someone is deliberately misleading, does not keep commitments or is incapable of performing the essential functions of their work. Of all the weaknesses to address, this area is the most likely to cause defensiveness. This area is also most likely to cause others to deal with the person who has the fatal flaw with extreme measures ranging from total avoidance to verbal attacks. Certainly, finding a way to talk about this openly and deal with it is critical to any success.

      With any weakness, being able to acknowledge they exist and identifying what type they are can lead to effective strategies for improvement. Both weaknesses and strengths are development opportunities if they are addressed with the respect required to avoid defensiveness and the honesty required to impact needed change.

      The principle behind all of this is: growth or progress can only come after you see the gap between what you need to succeed and what you are doing now. Defensiveness comes from a lack of humility. Any lack of humility will blind you to the truth. The truth really can set you free.

    author: "John Baker",
    image: mission,
    content: `
      First, let’s establish a mutual understanding of terms. People often find themselves in a conversation, debating what they think are different sides of an issue, only to realize they agree in principle and are arguing terminology. Below is an understanding of common terms that don’t always have common meaning:

      Values – The basic principle-centered ideals from which an individual measures the worth of actions, interactions, and outcomes. Examples: loyalty, honesty, fidelity, compassion, etc.

      Vision – What a person sees as a desired reality to come. What one wants to be or become as an individual or an organization. Examples: “I would like to be wise and kind”. Or, “Our Company will be a place where people enjoy their work and others value the work we do.”

      Mission – What will it take to accomplish the vision? What do we all want to accomplish? How will we meet the needs and expectations of our stakeholders? Examples: “I will facilitate the success of others.” Or, “We will provide quality responsible services, which will provide security and fulfillment to employees; win/win partnerships with our vendors; profitable return on investment for owners; and positive contribution to our community.”

      Plan – The strategic plan developed and written to accomplish specific stakeholder outcomes

      Practices – Systems implemented and actions taken to follow through on the plan

      ### What a Mission Statement is Not

      A mission statement is not a few magic words that inspire the otherwise confused masses to greatness. Nor is it orders from the boss to tell employees what’s really important around here.

      No, there is nothing intrinsically magical about a mission statement. A mission statement in which employees have no ownership or put no value is more likely to motivate negatively than positively. One of the major benefits of mission statements also happens to be what creates great risk. A mission statement serves to help judge the integrity of actions and decisions with the stated values of the company. Therefore, if actions or decisions are consistently considered to not be in line with stated values, the integrity of the actor(s) or decision maker(s) is suspect, maybe even ridiculed. After all, nobody likes a hypocrite.

      Though no one intends to act in ways that encourage others to label them harshly, negative conclusions do commonly occur when others can’t see the connection between what is said and done. It’s that if-I-don’t-know-I’ll-make-it-up thing. When we do make it up, for some reason it’s seldom pretty. In other words, if we’re not walking the talk, what we say will come back to hurt us.

      Understanding even some of the risk, why would anyone ever want to invest time and money in developing a mission statement?

      ### What a Mission Statement Is

      A mission statement reflects a deep understanding of mutual purpose, giving all actions taken on behalf of the company united value and direction. It can serve as a gauge – even a lodestar – by which the value of actions and decisions can be measured. To each individual, a mission statement can provide a sense of personal direction and orientation within the company. “I get the big picture and know how I can contribute.”

      According to Stephen Covey, trust is the highest form of human motivation. Though most of us readily acknowledge the value of a high-trust environment, we often feel the negative results of violated trust and don’t even know how we got there. For many of us, trust is either there or it isn’t. What value, then, would we put on being able to deliberately create the conditions of trust?

      The ability to identify or create mutual purpose is essential in establishing conditions of trust. If I know that you want what I want, I don’t have to worry about manipulation or hidden agendas. A mission statement that is well conceived, written, communicated and integrated into the company’s culture can provide the basis of trust to help an organization move forward. Of course, that’s only the beginning. Good leadership and management require using this focal point to measure the worth of ongoing behaviors and doing so in a way that is motivating and logical.

      In the development of a mission statement, process is more important than product. Experience has taught that involvement is a major factor in commitment. If you want employees to be committed to the interests of the company, they need to be significantly involved in the process. “I am more willing to commit to ‘our’ cause than ‘your’ cause.”

      An effective mission statement acknowledges consideration of all of the stakeholders of the company. If we truly believe “the customer is always right,” we may soon find we are unable to meet customer demands. Without the commitment of investors, employees, vendors, and the community, we will find the resources required to meet our obligations are lacking or not there at all. Likewise, focusing only on any one of the stakeholders and/or neglecting any of the other stakeholders exposes an Achilles heel. This vulnerability can often prove to be an unexpected setback or downfall just when we’re moving full speed ahead and we think the world is our oyster. With this in mind, a balanced mission can create a solid foundation upon which lasting success can be built. Having clearly identified and articulated the needs of each stakeholder group provides the basis for a relevant strategic plan. This same sense of mission will allow the organization to measure the success of that plan.

      In the final analysis, it comes down to what we want and what we’re willing to do about it. Developing a mission statement isn’t a quick and easy process; not if we want to do it right. If done poorly or we’re not willing to commit to it, it may even do more harm than good. And yet, if we want to be a great company and not just good, the process of developing a mission statement can be an essential contribution to a company of qualified, committed people working together to accomplish mutual purpose.

      You don't understand... We’re a technology company; health care; construction; scientists; engineers; consultants; retail. You wouldn’t understand – we’re from the Southeast; Southwest; Midwest; Northwest; Northeast; New York City; Montana; China; India; Africa. You couldn’t possibly understand me I’m a millennial, baby boomer, gen Xer. Over the years, I enjoyed the opportunity of working with a great variety of people and organizations. Each one of them taught me something valuable. As diverse as these individuals are, they almost all share a number of things in common. Probably most notable (and predictable) is the announcement that they are completely different than anyone I have ever worked with before.

      My sarcastic reply has been, “You may be right, let’s test your theory. Do you have people who work here? Do you sell to people? Are any of your vendors people? If not, you are right; I can’t possibly understand and it will be impossible for me to help you.” All right, I know that’s a smart-aleck attitude. I don’t always say it exactly that way. I’m certainly not saying I know all there is about being human. However, I have learned to trust and work from very reliable principles and processes.

      I’m not saying each and every individual and organization isn’t unique and special. Individual worth is a very important. For me, it’s a fundamental value. I am saying often the key to creating solutions and moving forward with integrity is anchored in understanding fundamental principles of what it means to be human. (I’ve identified at least four in my organizational culture model. This will be the subject of another article.) Based on these principles, trends and themes can be identified that lead to important insights. This makes it possible to build on agreement while understanding, appreciating and learning from differences. All told, we’re a lot more alike than we are different.

      I strive to work from the concept of people’s need to be understood. In fact, I have seen no benefit in impressing people with how smart I am. That just doesn’t open any door I want to go through. Yet, when people feel I understand them, they are willing to begin the coaching process. This demonstrates an important factor in being worthy of trust.

      Before we swing the pendulum too far from each person being completely unique in the world to everyone being carbon copies of each other, I want to identify the powerful balance of both perspectives. To truly gain understanding and establish trust and credibility, we must simultaneously see people and organizations in both the shared traits that make us human and the unique characteristics that make us individuals. The common ground and complementary strengths.

      Similar to the side of the pendulum that says “I am completely unique and no one understands me,” is the opposing side where everyone sees things just like me – “I am the standard of intelligence and good judgment.” The term, “common sense” usually describes the second side of the pendulum. When we lament that others are not using or don’t have common sense, we’re saying “they don’t think like I do.” (I don’t believe there is such a thing as common sense. If common sense really existed, there would be no reason to come up with a term for it.)

      Both sides of the pendulum serve the same purpose. In their entrenched conditions, they are obstacles to learning and growth. In both cases the statement, “I am already right and have nothing to learn” comes out loud and clear.

      It’s apparent that the need to be understood is real and important. Therefore, your willingness and ability to understand others is an essential prerequisite to your opportunity to contribute. The more difficult challenge arises in working with people and organizations who invest energy in not being understood. These are the folks who continue to proclaim “you don’t understand” in spite of your best efforts to listen, reflect and empathize. Maybe this is to cover a flawed thought process. Maybe it’s to excuse or rationalize resistance to change. Maybe it developed into a pattern of habit resulting in a persistent feeling of helplessness which, believe it or not, creates an uncomfortable comfort zone. It is always difficult to have our reality challenged. In any event, putting others in a category of not understanding supports our need to control and creates an impenetrable barrier to their ability to influence us. There is a dysfunctional power in being misunderstood.

      I believe a fundamental factor of this barrier to understanding is people often don’t know the difference between understanding and agreeing. If we start with disagreement, understanding serves no purpose other than to threaten the status quo and our rightness. Ironically, there can be no basis of either agreement or disagreement until a full understanding is reached. The advice of Stephen Covey given so many years ago – seek first to understand – may seem passe yet it still holds true. Until we understand, we are not qualified to agree, disagree, or add information.

      Why then does it so often seem our nature to seek first to disagree? I promise, much more progress comes from identifying even a sliver of agreement to build on rather than negotiating through mountains of disagreement. Agility or the ability to adjust to an ever-changing landscape consistently proves to be essential to long-term success. This requires constant learning and change. The need to be misunderstood is often the first and greatest barrier to agility or coach-ability.

      I often hear people say they are working with people who create needless barriers to being understood. “If they would be open to what I have to teach them we could make more progress.” “If they would start with and build on what we have in common, it would really help us to reach our goals.” And so, it would. Yet, I have gained even greater benefit from understanding and overcoming my own propensity to block the influence of others because of my need to be right. I guess I’m not that different after all. Are you … really?

      Many leaders are faced with the challenge of taking their organizations to another level.

      This transition comes in many forms, such as an entrepreneur who has successfully taken the company to a point that will require a team of leaders to continue the progress; a family business that has been around for years that must hand it off to the next generation; or a company that exists successfully in its market and sees opportunity in a larger or expanded market.

      This is where organizations often hit a wall. The problem, as with individual career development, is the behaviors that created success at one level all but guarantee failure at the next.

      For example, as entrepreneurs drive their business to success, they should turn a blind eye and deaf ear to all those who say it cannot be done. They must be aware of all the obstacles facing the fledgling organization and overcome them, often through sheer determination.

      As the organizations grow, however, their capacity is reached and they become the bottleneck. The tactics that bring an organization to life become the behaviors that stunt their growth.

      ### Responsibility Turnover

      Entrepreneurs must transition from the hero leading the charge and creating a successful start-up through sheer will and determination to steward leaders whose influence strengthens a management team and creates scalable alignment with the mission.

      It is critical to identify this behavioral change as an emotional process more than a cognitive one. People don’t do what they do because of what they know, they do it because of how they feel. How many times do parents ask their children, “Why did you do that – you know better?” That’s the wrong question. Seeking to understand feelings would be more fruitful.

      Likewise, it is no wonder entrepreneurs, who have invested their energy and identity to bringing organizations to life, have trouble turning the company over to someone else. Contrasting perspectives are seen emotionally as the enemy to progress and a personal affront. An entrepreneur struggles to distinguish the feedback of pessimistic naysayers from those who could be trusted advisors. The habit of going full speed ahead without considering the risks that were required in the organization’s infancy ceases to be a necessary survival technique and becomes destructive.

      When this happens, the introspection required to improve leadership and results lies outside the realm of consideration. The leader is often seen as ego-centric, with self-awareness viewed as the missing characteristic. Therefore, entrepreneurs are not aware of their full effect on their organizations.

      Research and experience show the twin characteristics of great leadership to be humility and strength of will. In a culture where humility is interpreted as weakness, it is a characteristic that proves to be a prerequisite for influential yet invisible leadership. Humility alerts entrepreneurs to habits that restrict empowerment of the next generation of leaders and helps overcome them.

      ### Overcoming Personality

      Because this transition is so difficult, many think it’s impossible. The very term entrepreneur creates an insurmountable obstacle. It’s often believed by labeling a personality type, one can categorize and predict behavior. If you want to avoid change and excuse your behavior, identify your personality type and say, “That’s just the way I am.”

      To overcome the behavioral obstacles to leading at the next level, you have to identify what you really want and do what it takes to get there. The key to change won’t be found in the deterministic thinking of personality typing. You can begin the journey by identifying a compelling value proposition.

      The process of leading through critical transitions lies in three overarching components:

      First, identify a compelling vision for your future role. This will be something worth working for. It will bring personal fulfillment and be aligned with the ongoing needs of the organization.

      Second, create an organizational structure starting with the leadership team you trust. This does not mean cloning yourself. This would only serve to increase overhead without embracing the diversity of thought or skill required for the larger organization.

      The third and most difficult step is to change habits. This is where the combination of humility and strength will be required in large doses.

      With a compelling vision, the right team of leaders, a solid game plan and good coaching, the entrepreneur can learn to become a leader of greater influence while unlocking the potential of the organization.

      Many of us have had the experience of an employee or coworker entering our office and asking “Can I talk to you?” Often the next request is for an assurance of confidentiality. Though this seems like a simple and common interaction, what comes next has caused a dilemma for people at all levels of organizations. I have seen CEOs and front-line employees alike struggle to get out of this predicament. How you handle this situation will either enhance your credibility or damage it.

      You can agree to give audience to your colleague and assure confidentiality. In doing so you not only show support to an employee facing a challenge, you validate your open-door policy. After all, open dialogue provides valuable information and directly affects the quality of decision making. Better decision making directly affects the quality of outcomes. Or so it would seem…

      Complications occur when you receive information that you feel needs to be dealt with in a more open forum in order to solve a problem or avoid negative consequences. Keeping this information confidential may prove awkward if it involves others who trust you. For example, you find yourself in a situation where another colleague believes he is in an open honest conversation with you. Yet, you are holding back information that is important to this person. In essence you’ve allowed someone to place a burden on you that you feel honor-bound to carry and helpless to solve. If keeping what you’ve learned confidential creates sufficient risk, you may actually break your promise and share the information in order to alleviate the danger; a classic no-win situation.

      On the other hand, you can tell the person you will not hear their concerns or will not promise confidentiality. Refusing to listen may keep you from being burdened by another’s problem. You are still likely, however, to be effected by the problem you’ve chosen not to hear. You’ve also failed to connect with a coworker when collaboration is a key to organizational success. You can assent to listen, but looking ahead, say that you can not assure confidentiality. In this case, your petitioner is unlikely to feel safe and will not know how to proceed.

      In this situation, as with many others, what can become a violation of trust is caused by unclear purpose and the absence of simple ground rules.

      Before you provide an answer, you need to increase your own understanding of this person’s request and intentions. Knowing the expectations will allow you to respond in a way that meets the needs of your associate. Adding a clear understanding of your own role and you responsibilities to the overall mission will allow you to act with confidence and integrity. You have the opportunity to provide assistance to a fellow employee and contribute to the success of the organization you serve.

      You can fit your assistance to the expectations of your associate by asking two questions and establishing one basic ground rule.

      1) Is he looking for a sounding board? or...

      2) Is he expecting your help to solve a problem?

      You can maintain a higher level of trust with your company and others by agreeing to a simple ground rule:

      “If the information you are about to share puts our company or others at risk, I will not be able to assure confidentiality.”

      Is he looking for a sounding board to let off steam or process his thoughts? If he needs a sounding board, you can provide a listening ear and possibly some feedback that helps him to deal with the problem he is facing. In this case, the concern may not require a specific solution, only to be more clearly understood or seen from a different perspective. If a significant problem remains, you may need to brainstorm solutions to help him feel prepared to confront the issue.

      He may find the second question applies to his concern. Does he have an expectation that with your assistance the circumstances causing concern will be changed? If he says he is asking for help to solve a problem, you should inform him that others may need to be involved in order to get the outcome he is looking for. In this case help him to create a plan of action. Then identify who those others should be and include them in the problem-solving process.

      Before any discussion occurs, make certain you have agreement on the ground rule. This assures your colleague that you not only have his best interest in mind, you also bear a responsibility to other stakeholders. In almost all cases this condition is understood and accepted. In the rare case when it is not, your associate can choose not to share information before you are put in a position to violate his trust or fail to live up to your stewardship in the organization.

      Should this condition cause him to decide not to continue with the conversation, you may want to advise him to seek help from HR or even an EAP.

      Finally, it is important to remember your own role. There should be no expectation that you serve as therapist, counselor or clergy. In this case, you are in a professional setting. You are not bound by regulations, license, or oath: all you have is your word. As I stated in the opening paragraph, your choice will enhance your credibility or damage it. If you establish clarity of purpose and consider the needs of all of your stakeholders, you will be able to bring value to a colleague seeking assistance as well as the organization you serve.
